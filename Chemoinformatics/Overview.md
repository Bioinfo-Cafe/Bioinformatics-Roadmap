# Overview
Chemoinformatics is the intersection of chemistry, computer science, and information science.
It deals with storing, analyzing, and modeling chemical data (compounds, reactions, structures) to support drug discovery, material design, and molecular research.
It’s like bioinformatics but for chemical data. 
# Applications of Chemoinformatics
1. **Drug Discovery & Design**: Virtual screening, QSAR modeling, predicting ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity).
2. **Materials Science**: Designing polymers, catalysts, and nanomaterials.
3. **Toxicology**: Predicting chemical toxicity and safety.
4. **Metabolomics & Systems Biology**: Linking chemical compounds to metabolic pathways.
5. **Chemical Databases**: Efficient storage, retrieval, and querying of massive compound libraries.
6. **Precision Medicine**: Personalizing drug treatment based on patient-specific chemical-genomic interactions.
# Tolls and Platforms
1. **Programming**: Python, R, sometimes Java/C++
2. **Core Libraries (Python)**:

*RDKit*→ cheminformatics toolkit (fingerprints, descriptors, similarity search, docking prep).  
*Open Babel* → chemical file conversion, molecular manipulation.  
*DeepChem* → ML and deep learning for molecular data.  
*ChemPy* → symbolic computations in chemistry.  
3. **Databases**:  
*PubChem*  
*ChEMBL* (bioactive molecules)  
*ZINC* (virtual screening)  
*DrugBank* (approved & experimental drugs)  
4. **Visualization & Molecular Modeling**:  
*PyMOL*  
*Avogadro*  
*Jmol*  
5. **Machine Learning Tools**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
