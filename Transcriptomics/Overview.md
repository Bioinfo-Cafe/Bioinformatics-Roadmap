# Overview
Transcriptomics is the study of the complete set of RNA transcripts (the transcriptome) produced by the genome under specific conditions. It provides insight into gene expression, splicing variants, non-coding RNAs, and regulatory mechanisms.  
Applications include:
1. Identifying differentially expressed genes in diseases.
2. Understanding cell-type specific expression (single-cell RNA-Seq).
3. Exploring regulatory networks (transcription factors, miRNAs, lncRNAs).
4. Biomarker and therapeutic target discovery.
