# Overview
AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) are applied in bioinformatics to find patterns, predict outcomes, and accelerate research from large biological datasets.
Applications include:  
**Genomics**: variant calling, disease-gene associations, population genetics.  
**Transcriptomics**: clustering expression profiles, cancer subtype classification  
**Proteomics and Drug Discovery**:protein structure prediction (AlphaFold), ligand binding prediction, virtual screening.  
**Medical Bioinformatics**: predicting drug response, personalized medicine.  
**Systems Biology**: modeling biological networks.

# Roadmap to Learning AI/Ml in Bioinformatics
## Stage 1: Foundations
1. Math: Probability,statistics, linear algebra (You can learn the maths part as you go, for those not coming from Computer science and Maths major)
2. Programmming: Python for Data science (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
3. Bioinformatics: Foundation knowledge in genomcis, transcriptomics, proteomics
## Stage 2: Core ML Concepts
1. Learn Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
2. Algorithms: Linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, random forests
3. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA,t-SNE, UMAP)
4. Practise with Scikit-learn on small datasets
## Stage 3: Deep Learning
1. Neural Networks, CNNs (for sequence/images), RNNs/LSTMs (for biological time-series & sequences)
2. Frameworks: Tensorflow, Pytorch
3. Project: Build a neural network to classify gene expression data into cancer vs normal
## Stage 4: Specialized Bioinformatics Application
1. Genomics: Predict variant pathogenicity using ML.
2. Drug discovery: QSAR modeling, binding affinity prediction with DeepChem.
3. Proteomics: Protein structure-function prediction.
4. Transcriptomics: Cell type clustering with ML (single-cell data).
## Stage 5: Advanced Topics
